# Trip_management_system
 A C++ based Trip Management System that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

The system provides two trip planning options:

1. **Packages** â€“ Predefined trip packages with fixed itineraries and prices.  
2. **Customization** â€“ Build your own trip by selecting destinations, accommodations, and activities.

After the selection, the program generates a **final invoice** with a detailed cost breakdown.


## ðŸš€ Features
- Console-based interactive interface
- Modular design using multiple C++ classes
- OOP principles for cleaner structure and maintainability
- Dynamic pricing for both packages and custom trips
- Final invoice generation with detailed pricing

## ðŸ›  Concepts Used
- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance** â€“ Extending base trip features for packages and custom trips
- **Encapsulation** â€“ Private attributes with getters/setters
- **Polymorphism** â€“ Overridden methods for invoice calculation
- **Constructors & Destructors** â€“ For initialization and cleanup

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. **Choose Trip Type**  
   Select between **Packages** or **Customization**.
   
2. **View Options**  
   - Packages: Shows available trip packages with details.  
   - Customization: Choose destinations, accommodations, and activities.
   
3. **Generate Invoice**  
   Displays a complete cost breakdown and total amount.
